        <h1>BACKUP and DISASTER RECOVERY</h1>
          Today, the world is increasingly reliant on IT, where mobile offices are becoming commonplace, and data theft is a serious risk to business stability, the security of your business information is paramount. You need a backup and disaster recovery solution that will fulfil all your unique business requirements.
        </br>
          The Missing Link leaves nothing to chance. Our backup and disaster recovery solutions will keep your critical data safe end-to-end, while also easing management of compliance with general and industry-specific regulatory requirements. We have the depth of experience across industries, and across organisations large and small, to design and implement an architecture that will scale with your growth, and aims to set new benchmarks for reliability and performance. 
        </br>
        <h3>Backup</h3>
          We offer a number of different backup solutions which can be tailor-made for your business including traditional and cloud-based solutions. Our backup services include both managed and self-managed backup, or consulting services if you own your own backup system. 
        </br>
          Our Backup-as-a-Service option, SmartPROTECT® delivers a wide range of architecturally designed, highly scalable, managed or self-managed backup solutions. SmartPROTECT® ensures continuous incremental data backups so your business processes aren't impacted and it provides near-instant data recovery from any point in the data archive. 
        </br>
          SmartPROTECT® can be tailored to meet your needs whether your organisation is a single office or a large enterprise. Our onsite, offsite and hybrid cloud-based data protection solutions are ideal for clients that want to achieve information resiliency and 24/7 operational recovery across data assets. We’ve invested heavily in our infrastructure so that multiple copies of your data can be stored at our two data centres, one in Sydney and one in Melbourne. With complete redundancy, you can be assured that we will keep your data safe, secure and accessible, 24/7. 
        </br>
          If you’d prefer to own and manage your own backup system we can advise you on the best technologies to suit your needs and ensure you’re equipped with an optimised solution to suit your budget and risk mitigation requirements. Our Engineers can design the optimal backup system for you to own and self manage if required. 
        </br>
        <h3>Disaster Recovery</h3>
          71% of organisations can tolerate 15 minutes to 3 hours of downtime¹ 8% can tolerate zero downtime²
          Nearly 60% of organisations don't have a disaster recovery plan in place³ 
          Every company should understand the importance of having a disaster recovery (DR) plan in place. Typically disaster recovery plans are used in the event of a software failure, data breach, power outage or human error. Historically, disaster recovery has been considered complex and time-consuming but with new technology this doesn't have to be the case. The combination of virtualisation and cloud technology has made disaster recovery both simple and affordable. 
        </br>
          Subscription-based models are becoming increasingly popular as they can provide elastic monthly bills, offering flexibility. There are no or minimal upfront costs and no termination fees plus they have a comparatively low price per instance protected. Some solutions even work with virtualised or physical servers running Linux or Windows so you can protect legacy and standalone systems as well. 
        </br>
          The Cost of Downtime The real cost of downtime takes into two crucial factors the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and the Recovery Time Objective (RTO). The RPO refers to the point in time that you need to revert back to which could be seconds, minutes or hours depending on your business. To find your desired RPO ask yourself – how much data can we afford to lose?
        </br>
          The RTO refers to the time it takes to recover the data, how long can your business afford to be down for? Again, the RTO could be hours, weeks or minutes. These two objectives along with recovery process data and downtime costs are used to calculate your recovery time. Use our calculator now to work out your estimated downtime, total downtime cost and to see what your costs are based on your desired RPO and RTO.
        </br>
          Our Infrastructure Engineers can work with you to help implement a robust Disaster Recovery plan in the event of a disaster.     
        </br>
